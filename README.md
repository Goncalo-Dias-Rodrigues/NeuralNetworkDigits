# NeuralNetworkDigits
This project implements a simple neural network in Java. It was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course with the goal of distinguishing between the digits 0 and 1 from the MNIST dataset. The repository includes both the code for training the network and the pre-trained network using the weights that enable correct classification. The network achieved 100% accuracy on the tested digits.

Developed in collaboration with Daniel Gonçalves and Diogo Damásio.
